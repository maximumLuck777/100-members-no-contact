# --- summary ---
# made by a certain shadowrendkioll dude
# this is a power up thats all you need to know
# make the variables be exported for ease of use

# ----bugs------
# there is a little bug where the spin metre
# stays full for a whole three seconds even when moving
# after picking this up

# sees if the body has the ability to gain energy
# can be used to stop objects from taking the energy meant for the player
# it would be cool to see enemies taking this energy powerup as well
